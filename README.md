# üõçÔ∏è Contoso Retail SQL Analytics : Store Sales

This SQL project showcases retail analytics using the `ContosoRetailDW` data warehouse. It focuses on in-store sales from the `FactSales` table and was built entirely with **SQL Server** and **Visual Studio Code**, following best practices for clean SQL, reusable views, and modular analysis. This project analyzes revenue and profitability trends from Contoso's in-store sales using only SQL ‚Äî no BI tools or external code required.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL joins and filtering  
- Creating and querying SQL views  
- Data warehouse modeling (star schema)  
- Revenue and profitability analysis  
- Clean folder and project structure

## Tools Used
- SQL Server 2022  
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Visual Studio Code (with SQL Server extension)

## Dataset: ContosoRetailDW

Microsoft's sample data warehouse simulating a retail business.  
This project focuses on the **store sales fact table** and related dimensions:

- `FactSales` ‚Äî transactional sales data from physical stores
- `DimProduct`, `DimProductSubcategory` ‚Äî product information
- `DimDate` ‚Äî order dates
- `DimStore` ‚Äî store metadata
- `DimGeography` ‚Äî city/state/country of each store

---

## Data Cleaning: `vw_CleanedSales`

The view `vw_CleanedSales` was created to:
- Join all relevant dimensions to `FactSales`
- Convert surrogate keys into readable fields
- Filter out rows with 0 sales
- Compute profit (`SalesAmount - TotalCost`)

üìÅ Stored in `views/vw_CleanedSales.sql`

| SalesKey | Transaction ID |

- `average_order_value_by_store.sql`: Average order by store
![Average order by store Output](./results/average_order_value_by_store.png)
- `monthly_revenue_trend.sql`: Sales trend over time
- `profit_by_store.sql`: Total profit per store
- `revenue_by_country_state.sql`: Geographic revenue breakdown
- `top_brands_by_profit.sql`: Geographic revenue breakdown 
![Top Brands Output](./results/top_brands_output.png)


Each query is modular, readable, and ready to be reused in dashboards or reports.

## Example Query: Top 5 Brands by Profit

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    BrandName,
    SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM vw_CleanedSales
